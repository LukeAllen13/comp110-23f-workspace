# I would rate this album a 3.4/5
# I like the memories it brings back from my childhood. I like the unique style he brings into the album as 
# a whole and am impressed with how it has stood throughout the years.
# I am not a huge fan of the transition from the songs 3 4 and 5 in the playlist named Our First Time, Runaway Baby, and The Lazy Song.
